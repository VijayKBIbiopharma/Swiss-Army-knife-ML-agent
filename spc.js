  /* ---------- Capability when the data is not bell-shaped ----------

     Withholding the tail figures, which is what happens above when Anderson-Darling fails,
     is correct and is still a dead end: a QC group that has to write a specification this
     week is left with Cp, Cpk and a count. There is a standard way out that does not
     require pretending - transform the measurements to a scale where the shape IS normal,
     transform the specification limits the same way, and compute the tail there.

     Box-Cox picks the power that makes the transformed data as normal as possible, by
     maximising the profile likelihood over lambda. The crucial discipline is that
     normality is then TESTED AGAIN on the transformed values, and the figures are still
     withheld if the transform did not fix it. A transform that failed is not a licence to
     report; impurity data with a hard floor at zero and a long right tail is usually fixed
     by lambda near 0, which is the log, and a bimodal distribution is not fixed by any
     lambda at all, because no power of a two-humped variable is bell-shaped.

     The transform is monotone increasing for every lambda, so the limits keep their order
     and the probability below a limit is preserved exactly - which is what makes the tail
     figure in the transformed space the right answer in the original one. */

  /* ---------- Charts for things you count ----------

     The I-MR chart above is built for measurements: a titer, a pH, a purity. A great deal of
     quality data is not measured but counted - particles in a vial, vials rejected at
     inspection, deviations in a month, colonies on a plate - and running a counted series
     through a measurement chart gets the limits wrong, because the spread of a count is not
     free to be anything: a Poisson count's standard deviation is the square root of its own
     mean, and a proportion's depends on how many units were looked at.

       c   defects per constant opportunity   particles per vial, deviations per month
       u   defects per unit, varying size     particles per mL, deviations per 1000 batches
       p   proportion of units defective      share of vials rejected at inspection

     And then the part that matters more than the choice between them. The textbook limits
     above assume the counts really are Poisson or binomial - that every vial has the same
     underlying rate. Real counts almost never do: particles cluster by batch, by stopper
     lot, by shift, so the rate itself moves and the observed spread is wider than the
     square-root law allows. That is overdispersion, and a chart that ignores it draws
     limits far too tight and then fires constantly at a process that is behaving.

     So dispersion is measured rather than assumed, and reported. If the counts are wider
     than the model allows, Laney's correction is applied: standardise every point, take the
     spread of that standardised series from its average moving range - deliberately, since
     a moving range is barely moved by the shifts the chart exists to find - and widen the
     limits by it. When the counts really are Poisson that factor comes out near 1 and the
     chart is the textbook one, so the correction costs nothing when it is not needed. Both
     sets of limits are returned, with a recommendation, because a reader deserves to see
     how much of the alarm was the chart. */

  /* ---------- When the event is rare: chart the gaps, not the rate ----------

     At a tenth of a percent, a proportion chart is mostly noise. Inspect a thousand
     containers and expect one finding: the subgroup proportion is 0, 0.001, 0.002, the
     limits sit on top of each other, and the lower limit is zero - so the chart can signal
     that things got worse and can never signal that they got better. Four departments in
     this tool name that gap, and it is the same gap each time.

     The fix is to stop charting the rate and start charting the distance between events:
     containers inspected between findings, or days between failures. Those gaps carry every
     event individually instead of summarising a thousand of them into one dot, and they
     have a distribution worth using - geometric for counted opportunities, exponential for
     elapsed time.

     What must not be done to them is three sigma. Both distributions are heavily skewed, so
     a symmetric band is wrong on both sides. The lower limit lands below zero and is clamped
     away, and on a chart of GAPS that is the expensive half: gaps get shorter when the rate
     goes up, so a lower limit that cannot be crossed is a chart that cannot tell you
     contamination is increasing. (It is the mirror of the proportion chart's failure, where
     a lower limit of zero hides an improvement.) So the limits here are
     PROBABILITY limits: the points in each tail that carry alpha/2 of the distribution,
     computed from the fitted parameter rather than from a standard deviation. What three
     sigma would have given is computed too and reported beside them, because the difference
     is the argument for doing it this way. */

  /* ---------- The small sustained shift, which a Shewhart chart is worst at ----------

     The I-MR chart above looks at one point at a time, so it is excellent at a spike and
     poor at a drift: a half-sigma shift leaves almost every point inside the limits, and
     the Nelson run rules were added precisely to patch that. There are two charts built for
     it from the start, and they work by remembering.

       CUSUM  accumulates how far each point sits from target, minus a slack term, and
              signals when the running total crosses a decision interval. Nothing is
              forgotten, so a persistent small bias piles up.

       EWMA   is a weighted average where the weight decays, so recent points matter most
              and older ones fade. Its limits widen over the first few points as the average
              fills up, which is the exact form rather than the asymptotic one.

     Both are tuned to the same in-control false alarm rate as a three-sigma chart, so the
     comparison between them is fair and the choice is about what you want to catch rather
     than about how often you want to be interrupted. The parameters here - k = 0.5 with
     h = 4.77, and lambda = 0.2 with L = 2.962 - are the standard pairings for an in-control
     run length near 370, and the tests measure that rather than taking it on trust.

     The trade, measured rather than assumed. Both beat the plain chart by a wide margin on
     a small sustained shift: at one sigma the average wait is ten points against forty-five.
     On a large sudden jump the plain chart does not win - EWMA matches it point for point -
     but CUSUM costs one point above about three and a half sigma, because its slack term has
     to be paid back before the running sum can cross. That is the whole price, and it is in
     the output rather than left as a caveat somebody else discovers. */
