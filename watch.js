/* Links out to video explanations, one lesson at a time.

   This is the only file in the project that knows a web address exists, and it holds
   exactly one: the line marked PRIVACY-EXTERNAL-LINK, which builds a YouTube watch URL
   from a video id. Everything else here is an id, a title and a channel name. Nothing is
   fetched, embedded or preloaded - no iframe, no thumbnail, no script. A reader who never
   clicks has sent nothing anywhere, and the page's Content-Security-Policy is unchanged,
   because an ordinary link needs no permission that loading a resource would.

   Why links at all, in a tool whose point is that it works with the WiFi off: the academy
   is where someone learns, and the best explanation of gradient boosting is not one this
   project could write. The cost is honest and stated on the page - these need internet,
   and they leave the tool.

   Every link below was present in a live search index on 31 October 2026, under the title
   recorded here. That is what "checked" means: the video existed and was named this. It is
   not a promise that it still does, which is why the title and channel are stored beside
   the id - a dead link stays findable by searching for its title. Where no video could be
   attributed to a channel with confidence, the lesson gets a search phrase instead of a
   link, because an unattributed URL in a validated tool is worse than an honest blank. */
